The goal of this task was to design and implement a fully functional ATM (Automated Teller Machine) interface using Java. The application simulates real-world ATM operations, allowing users to perform transactions such as checking their balance, withdrawing funds, depositing money, and exiting the system.

Features Implemented:
1. User Authentication:
   - Users are required to enter a valid account number and PIN to access their account.
   - The system validates the credentials before allowing any transactions.

2. Main Menu:
   - Displays a user-friendly menu with the following options:
     - Check Balance
     - Withdraw Money
     - Deposit Money
     - Exit

3. Check Balance:
   - Displays the current balance of the user's account.

4. Withdraw Money:
   - Allows users to withdraw a specified amount from their account.
   - Validates the withdrawal amount to ensure it does not exceed the available balance.

5. Deposit Money:
   - Allows users to deposit a specified amount into their account.
   - Validates the deposit amount to ensure it is a positive value.

6. Exit:
   - Terminates the session and displays a goodbye message.

7. Error Handling:
   - Handles invalid inputs (e.g., negative amounts, incorrect PIN).
   - Provides appropriate error messages to guide the user.
